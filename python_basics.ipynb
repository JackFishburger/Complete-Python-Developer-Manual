    "2. Data types: values a program can hold to store information\n",

    "Python has several data types. We'll list them out and then discuss them individually. Notice that the REPL will highlight these data types, which clues us in that there is something special about them.\n",

    "A data type represents a value in Python, and writing a program allows us to take actions on these data types. Examples of actions include creating, changing/manipulating, storing, and removing data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Data Types:\n",
    "- `int`: integer (a whole number)\n",
    "- `float`: floating point number\n",
    "- `bool`: boolean\n",
    "- `str`: string\n",
    "- `list`\n",
    "- `tuple`\n",
    "- `set`\n",
    "- `dict`\n",
    "- `None`: the absence of value\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also create our own custom data types using something called classes. We'll explore how to do this later in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have specialized data types. They are special packages and modules we can use from libraries. They're a little something extra, an extension, beyond a standard Python data type."

    "This lecture will cover two data types: int and float. An integer is a number, such as 3, 4, or 5. We can use integers to perform mathematical operations in a program. The following code prints new numbers based on the mathematical operations we're performing on two whole numbers numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A float is a floating point number, or a number with a decimal point, such as 0.5. We need to make this distinction because a float takes up more space in memory compared to an integer on our machines. Adding an integer and a float will result in a float as will adding two floats together, even if the result is a whole number. For more information on floating point numbers, check out this [Floating Point Numbers video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZRI1IfStY0).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the syntax is intimidated, don't worry! As we work with these concepts more, it will become more familiar. And, if you're ever confused about a Python data type or anything else that has to do with the language, you can learn more about it in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/contents.html)."
